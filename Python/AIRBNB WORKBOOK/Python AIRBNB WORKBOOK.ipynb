    "### 50. What assumption can be made from the Question above?\n",
    "###### Here we see that homes that accommodate 2 with only one bed are listeded more often, therefore it will be approprite to assume that most bookings will be made mostly by couples. This could also explain why Bed and Breakfast's with \"private rooms\" are booked more often and generate the highest revenue, as in numbers 31 and 32. Therefore, advertisements can be geared towards married couples or people in relationships."
